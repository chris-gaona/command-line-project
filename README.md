# command-line-project

## Directions for use:
1. Use `git clone` to create a copy on your local machine.
2. `cd` into profile or weather directories to see the magic
3. Run `node app.js` passing in appropriate arguments on the command line

Example for profile directory: `node app.js chrisgaona`
Example for weather directory: `node app.js San Francisco, CA`

*FYI: You need to add some sort of api key to your project for the weather command line tool to work. For example, I used Weather Underground.*

Have fun!!
